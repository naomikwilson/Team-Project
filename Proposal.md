# Project Proposal

## 1. The Big Idea

The main idea of our project is to automate Financial Comparable Analysis for any industry (publicly-traded) given a series of tickers. Our program would analyze and benchmark on various metrics, then use the weighted average of percentile to perform an analysis of the target company versus a group of competitors to determine which ones are under/overvalued relative to how they rank. Project topics include API, Excel Manipulation, Automation, Software Design, and Financial Analysis. Our MVP is to create a program that manipulates a list of Excel files located in a local folder, thereby creating analysis straight on the Excel sheets. Our stretch goal is to design a program in which the user inputs the company/companies of interest and the program outputs if the company/companies are under or overvalued and by how much on the website interface.

## 2. Learning Objectives

Our shared learning goal is to become more familiar with automation using Python. In terms of individual learning goals, Naomi’s goals include (a) becoming more familiar with integrating different software/technology (e.g. APIs, Excel, website, Python) to perform a complex task and (b) improving knowledge of financial analysis. Sergio’s goals include (a) becoming familiar with software/technology to automate complex processes using tools and libraries (b) becoming more familiar with data structures and the methodology for approaching problems when coding (c) exploring the intersection of financial analysis and Python. 

## 3. Implementation Plan

Our implementation plan involves the following steps:
1. Conduct the Excel manipulation and financial analysis manually to better understand the methodology of our project.
2. Research tools and other Python libraries that will assist us with our approach – these include financial APIs, libraries such as Flask, data visualization, among others.
3. Polish code – work to optimize and debug code while working with front-end to create an interface for the user that meets our stretch goal.

## 4. Project Schedule

Our project schedule is included in the following table. Revisions will be made as needed as the project progresses.

| Week / Task Deadline | Project Timeline    |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1 - March 25         | Proposal            |
| 2 - April 1          | Initial Coding Work |
| 3 - April 8          | MVP                 |
| 4 - April 15         | Improvements        |
| 5 - April 22         | Stretch             | 
| 6 - April 29         | Trouble-Shooting    |

## 5. Collaboration Plan

Overall, our collaboration plan involves splitting the work as needed (as opposed to splitting deliverables and working independently). We will be working as collaborators on the same repository, which allows us to see and edit each other's code and therefore work more collaboratively. We plan to work in "sprints" or "blocks" where there is a clear objective at the end of each one (see our Project Schedule for more information). This allows us to work towards something and then test our project.

## 6. Risks and Limitations

In terms of threats to the project’s success, we believe the major risk is not being able to finish the project on time (great time management will be required), and the major limitation is our lack of experience in front-end development (which is particularly relevant for the stretch goal).

## 7. Additional Course Content

Topics that we believe will benefit our project include Excel, OpenAI API, and front-end coding.
